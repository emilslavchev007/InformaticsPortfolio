				<p class = "about"> My name is Emil Slavchev. I am a student at the American College of Sofia. I am in section 12/2, I was born in December of 2001. My hobbies are similar to those of anyone my age: I love spending time with my family and friends, travelling, boxing, listening to music, and photography. You’ll get a much better idea of who I am if I go into detail about each one, but I’ll rather let the pages on this website do that for me. Enjoy! </p>

		<div id="half1">	<h3 id = "it-title"> IT 12/2 </h3>	<p class= "it"> In 12th grade Informatics classes I learnt what HTML and CSS are and how to work with each one to make webpages. While I am an IT profile and am familiar with programming languages such as C++ and C#, I had no knowledge or experience in web development, so the class was very useful. We learned how to mark up a webpage with text and images, arrange it using ID, class, and div, and style it by adding colors, changing size and font, etc. The course was fun and enriching because I was introduced to a completely new field which has wide applications and is essential in today’s modern world. In the future I hope, even plan to expand my knowledge in HTML and CSS because while we learned a lot in IT class this semester, it covers only the basics, and there is so much more to learn and use when it comes to web design. </p>
